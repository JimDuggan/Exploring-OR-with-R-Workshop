# Exploring-OR-with-R-Workshop
Material to support my OR65 Workshop **Making an Impact - Exploring Operations Research with R** in Bath, September 2023.

There are five objectives of the workshop, which are to:

* Setup your own account on [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/)
* Use the option **New Project from Git Repository**, and enter https://github.com/JimDuggan/Exploring-OR-with-R-Workshop.
* Explore what a *tibble* is, and how it can store rectangular data
* Understand how to plot data from *tibbles* using the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) library.
* Understand how the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) library can be used to manipulate data.
* Explore and run the four case studies: (1) Exploratory Data Analysis, (2) Linear Programming, (3) Agent Based Simulation and (4) System Dynamics.

The R code examples are in the directory [code](https://github.com/JimDuggan/Exploring-OR-with-R-Workshop/tree/main/code).


All slides are in the directory [slides](https://github.com/JimDuggan/Exploring-OR-with-R-Workshop/tree/main/slides).


Once your project is created, open the file `install_packages.R` in the `setup` folder, and click on the button called "Source", as this will run the file.

Any of the R files should then run ok.
